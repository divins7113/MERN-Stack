# Capstone Project - News Platform

This project is a MERN stack application with Admin, Blog Writer, and Reader roles.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
*   Node.js installed on your machine.
*   MongoDB installed and running locally (or a cloud MongoDB URI).

### 2. Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies for both server and client:

```bash
# Install root dependencies (if any)
npm install

# Install Server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install Client dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 3. Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory to configure your database and environment variables:

```bash
# server/.env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/IDivins-Infographic
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
PORT=5000
```

### 4. Database Seeding (Create Admin)
To create the initial **Admin** account, you must run the seed script. This is the only way to create the first admin user.

Run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
node server/seed.js
```

**What this does:**
*   Clears the existing database.
*   Creates a default Admin user.
*   Prints the credentials to the console (or you can check the comments in `server/seed.js`).

### 5. Running the Application
Start both the backend and frontend:

```bash
# In the root directory (if concurrent script exists)
npm start

# OR run separately in two terminals:
# Terminal 1:
cd server && npm start

# Terminal 2:
cd client && npm start
```

## 🔑 Accessing Admin
Once the application is running, navigate to the login page (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/login`) and use the credentials generated by the seed script.

**Default Credentials:**
*   **Admin:** `admin@gmail.com` / `admin123`
*   **Blog Writer:** `writer@gmail.com` / `writer123`
*   **Reader:** `reader@gmail.com` / `reader123`

*(Note: Check `server/seed.js` if you have modified these credentials)*
